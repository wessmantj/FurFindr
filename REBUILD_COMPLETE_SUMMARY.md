    st.error(f"Error loading pets: {str(e)}")
    return []
```

**Image Loading:**

## Technical Improvements

### Database Optimization:

## What Still Needs Fixing (Production)

### Critical Issues Remaining:
1. **N+1 Query Problem** - Photos loaded in loop (slow with many pets)
2. **No loading states** - Users see blank during data load
3. **Session state memory leak** - Unlimited growth of liked/passed pets
4. **No logging** - Can't debug production issues
5. **No input validation** - Profile form accepts invalid data

### Estimated Time to Fix:
- N+1 query: 1 hour
- Loading states: 1 hour  
- Memory management: 30 min
- Basic logging: 30 min
- Input validation: 1 hour

**Total: ~4 hours to production ready**
